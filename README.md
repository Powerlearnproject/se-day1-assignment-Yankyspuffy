#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) â€“ NATO Conference
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at a NATO conference in 1968.
This was in response to the "software crisis," where projects were failing due to poor planning, high costs, and unreliable software.
It marked the beginning of structured software development methodologies.
2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
Before this, programming was mostly ad-hoc with spaghetti code (unstructured and hard to maintain).
The introduction of structured programming (e.g., by Edsger Dijkstra) emphasized using loops, conditionals, and functions, making code more readable and maintainable.
Languages like C, Pascal, and Ada promoted this structured approach.
3. The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced as a response to the inefficiencies of traditional waterfall models.
Agile focuses on iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, leading to popular frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.
It transformed how software is built, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

ðŸ”¹ Software Developer

Writes, tests, and maintains code.
Fixes bugs and integrates APIs.
Ensures software functionality and performance.
ðŸ”¹ Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

Tests software for bugs and performance issues.
Develops test plans and automation scripts.
Works with developers to improve quality.
ðŸ”¹ Project Manager

Plans, organizes, and oversees the project.
Manages timelines, budgets, and risks.
Ensures smooth communication between teams.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

ðŸ”¹ Unit Testing â€“ Tests individual components to catch early bugs.
ðŸ”¹ Integration Testing â€“ Ensures modules work together correctly.
ðŸ”¹ System Testing â€“ Checks the entire applicationâ€™s functionality.
ðŸ”¹ Acceptance Testing â€“ Confirms the software meets user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the skill of designing effective inputs (questions or instructions) to get accurate and relevant responses from AI models.

Importance in AI Interaction
âœ” Enhances AI Performance â€“ Well-crafted prompts lead to better, more precise answers.
âœ” Improves Efficiency â€“ Reduces the need for multiple retries or clarifications.
âœ” Customizes AI Output â€“ Helps tailor responses to specific needs, such as coding, content creation, or problem-solving.
âœ” Optimizes AI Capabilities â€“ Unlocks advanced model features like reasoning, summarization, and creativity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the key differences between electric and gasoline cars, including cost, maintenance, and environmental impact."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?
âœ” More Specific â€“ Focuses on a clear comparison between electric and gasoline cars.
âœ” Concise & Direct â€“ Avoids broad, open-ended requests.
âœ” Guides AI Output â€“ Specifies key aspects (cost, maintenance, environmental impact) for a well-structured response.
